This is just a simple collection of PHP classes I made that I use in all my personal applications. There are extensions to this for Illuminate ORM, Slim and a few others depending on what the app requires.

## Installation

PHP version 8.0 or higher is required.

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended method of installation.

```bash
composer require pitmanware/kentron
```

Or any PSR-4 autoloader.
